
1).what oops means?

*object-oriented programming loops is a style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects,
 closely linked with the methods (function with which they are associated it also include ideas of H.


2) what is polymorphism ?explain types?

* polymorphism is the ability to process object diffrently on the basis of their class and datatype. 

* There are two types namely 
                 i) compile time polymorphism 
                 ii) run time polymorphism


3) what is interface and example in selenium Javap Ans - webdriven is an Pnterface and we are

* Defining a reference variable (drives) whose type is an interface.

* Now any object we assign to it must be an instance of a class (firefoxdriver) that implements the interface.


4) what is abstract class and example?

* Abstract classes are essential to providing a an abstraction to the code to make it reusable and extendable.

* for example; a vehicle porcent class with Truck, and motorbike inheriting from P4 Ps an abstraction that easily allows more vehicles to be added.


5). difference between multiple Pohoptance and must level

The key difference between multiple and multilevel heritance is that multiple inheritance is when a class inherts from many base classes while multilevel inheritance is when a class inherit from derived class making that
derived class base class for a few class.


6) is multiple inheritance is possible in Jova ! when one class extends more than one classes Ans -

* then this is called multiple interPlance.

* for example: - class & extend Class A and B. then this type of in inheritance to known as multiple inheritance. but Java doesn't allow multiple inheritance.

7) what is Keyboard?

keyword for using in heritance is used to the extend keyword.

8). what is the Keyword to connect interface and class

* implements keyword.

9). what is diffreme between class And interface ?
 
* A class describe the attributes and behaviors of an object.

* An interface contains behaviors that a class implement & A class may contain abstract methods, concrete methods.

* An interface only abstract method.

10).what is the diffrence between class and abstract class?

* Abstract class can have static fields and static method , like other classes. 

* An abstract method class. cannot be declared as final. 

* only abstract. class can have abstract methods.
